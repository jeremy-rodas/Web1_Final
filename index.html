Barnes Avenue is located in the Bronx, New York. I lived in the Bronx for seven years of my life from 1996 to 2003. Where my family and I moved to Stamford, Conneticut and is where Iâ€™ve lived most of my life up to now.  From the apartment building I lived in I was able to base the design of my wallpaper on the window reliefs that would appear every so often.  I started with sketchs of the window reliefs, which eventually went into recreating the sketch in illustrator.  At that point I made the decision to focus on a smaller section of the on the reliefs.  Which is what the main design of the wallpaper is based on. From the main designs element I created two more designs from it in the form of dots and dashes. The dots and dashes are also used in the second wallpaper design to be international morse code. Repeating Barnes Avenue multiple times giving the secondary elements more reason to exisit than just sharing qualities of the main design element of the wallpaper.

    This was when I redesigned the the main element and added secondary elements to repeat. This was done to create more intrest in the design.

    The elements on the wallpaper were repeated more often to create more of a brick effect. I felt the need to see if the pattern would look over bearing or having it repeat more would let the pattern be more noticeable, I decided on going back to having the pattern repeat less.

    The final design differs by letting the secondary elements have a stronger tie to the original concept. Which is making it connect to back to where I've lived, this project is really about my home. The pattern is done in international morse code, repeating the phrase Barnes Avenue the street the apartment building is located.
